## programming languaes used:

html, css, javascript

## first step: 

I created an almost empty html file, with the `<meta>` tags:

![meta-tags] (images/metatags.png)

## second step:

I added a javascript file to my html file; 
At first you can notice a function that can create html elmements:

![function] (images/function.png)

If I declare tag name, Id and content of the element, this function provides for me DOM manipulation and proceed to create what I requested.
